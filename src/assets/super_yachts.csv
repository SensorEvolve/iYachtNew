The yacht had been docked at Blohm+Voss shipyard in Hamburg for refitting since October 2021. However, German authorities later clarified that the Dilbar was not seized but was subject to export control sanctions, preventing it from leaving Germany without special permission. By June 2022, Dilbar was valued at up to $750 million. At the start of the war, the Dilbar was in dry dock at the Blohm+Voss shipyard for an overhaul. The legal ownership of Dilbar is unclear. In April 2022, German federal police announced they had investigated the yacht and determined it belonged to Usmanov's sister, Gulbahor Ismailova, who was sanctioned that same month. Since 2022, the yacht has been owned by an independent trustee of an irrevocable family trust, with neither Usmanov nor his family members listed as beneficiaries.

She was launched and delivered in 2004 to the Cyprus-born British shipowner Andreas Liveras, initially named Annaliesse and measuring 85 meters in length. Just a year later, Liveras put the yacht up for sale at $103 million. In 2006, the price was reduced to $79 million, and another year later, an unnamed individual based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, purchased the superyacht, renaming it Delma. In 2013, Delma was listed for sale again, with a price tag of €53 million. She was later sold to American casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who sent the superyacht to the Italian shipyard Amico & Co for renovation, extending her by 6.5 meters. The yacht was then renamed Queen Miri, in honor of Adelson’s wife, Miriam Adelson. Queen Miri's exterior was designed by both Alpha Marine and Lally Poulias, while the interior was crafted by Massari Design. The yacht is now 92 meters long and can accommodate 36 guests across 18 cabins, with a crew of 36.

The yacht was designed by the engineering firm Knud E Hansen and was named Qadissiyat Saddam. It was luxuriously furnished and equipped with a rocket artillery system for protection. In case of emergency, the yacht could be evacuated through a secret corridor leading to a mini-submarine. Saddam Hussein never used the yacht  instead, it was gifted to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who renamed it Al Yamamah. It was moved to Jeddah and likely taken over by King Hussein of Jordan in 1995. In 2007, the yacht reappeared in Nice under the name Ocean Breeze and, the following year, became the subject of a dispute between its alleged owners, a company in the Cayman Islands, and the Iraqi state. It was renamed Basrah Breeze and returned to Iraq in 2010. Researchers from the University of Basra have used the vessel for marine studies in the Red Sea, and since 2018, it has been used as a hotel ship.;Government of Iraq;$100 000 000;;basrah_breeze;;30.51632, 47.84665;2023-07-01T14:00.000Z
